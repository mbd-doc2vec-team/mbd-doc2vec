doc1='anarchism is a political philosophy that advocates self governed societies based on voluntary institutions these are often described as stateless societies although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non hierarchical free associations anarchism considers the state to be undesirable unnecessary and harmful the following sources cite anarchism as a political philosophy slevin carl anarchism the concise oxford dictionary of politics ed iain mclean and alistair mcmillan oxford university press two zero zero three because anarchists generally believe that human beings are capable of managing their own affairs on the basis of creativity cooperation and mutual respect and when making individual decisions they are taking into account the concerns of others and the well being of society while anti statism is central anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of all human relations anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy many types and traditions of anarchism exist not all of which are mutually exclusive anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications ostergaard geoffrey anarchism the blackwell dictionary of modern social thought blackwell publishing p one four anarchism is usually considered a radical left wing ideology and much of anarchist economics and anarchist legal philosophy reflect anti authoritarian interpretations of communism collectivism syndicalism mutualism or participatory economics etymology and terminology the term wikt anarchismnarchism is a compound word composed from the word anarchy and the suffix ism themselves derived respectively from the greek i e anarchy from anarchos meaning one without rulers from the privative prefix an i e without and archos i e leader ruler cf archon or arkh i e authority sovereignty realm magistracy and the suffix or ismos isma from the verbal infinitive suffix izein the first known use of this word was in one five three nine various factions within the french revolution labelled opponents as anarchists as robespierre did the h bertists although few shared many views of later anarchists there would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling but they did not use the word anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was pierre joseph proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid nineteenth century since the one eight nine zero s and beginning in france the term libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the one nine five zero s in the united states its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic free market philosophy only referring to free market anarchism as libertarian anarchism history origins woodcut from a diggers document by william everard the earliest anarchist themes can be found in the six th century bc among the works of taoist philosopher laozi peter kropotkin anarchism encyclop dia britannica one nine one zero and in later centuries by zhuangzi and bao jingyan zhuangzi s philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist zhuangzi wrote a petty thief is put in jail a great wikt brigandrigand becomes a ruler of a nation diogenes of sinope and the cynics their contemporary zeno of citium the founder of stoicism also introduced similar topics jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the christian anarchist tradition georges lechartier wrote that the true founder of anarchy was jesus christ and the first anarchist society was that of the apostles in early islamic history some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the islamic civil war over the caliphate where the kharijites insisted that the imamate is a right for each individual within the islamic society later some muslim scholars such as amer al basri and abu hanifa led movements of boycotting the rulers paving the way to the waqf endowments tradition which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs but such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic taoist teachings and that of other anti authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not anarchism and religion are compatible this is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful idolatry the french renaissance political philosopher tienne de la bo tie wrote in his most famous work the discourse on voluntary servitude what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent the radical protestant christian gerrard winstanley and his group the diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the one seven th century in england the term anarchist first entered the english language in one six four two during the english civil war as a term of abuse used by royalists against their roundhead opponents anarchism bbc radio four program in our time thursday seven december two zero zero six hosted by melvyn bragg of the bbc with john keane professor of politics at university of westminster ruth kinna senior lecturer in politics at loughborough university and peter marshall philosopher and historian by the time of the french revolution some such as the enrag s began to use the term positively in opposition to jacobin centralisation of power seeing revolutionary government as oxymoron ic by the turn of the one nine

formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as philosophical anarchism he argued in political justice one seven nine three adams ian political ideology today manchester university press two zero zero one p one one six that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance he thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power rather he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution his aversion to the imposition of a rules based society led him to denounce as a manifestation of the people s mental enslavement the foundations of law property rights and even the institution of marriage he considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organization in each case government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment the french pierre joseph proudhon is regarded as the first self proclaimed anarchist a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work what is property published in one eight four zero it is for this reason that some claim proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory he developed the theory of spontaneous order in society where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests his famous quote on the matter is liberty is the mother not the daughter of order in what is property proudhon answers with the famous accusation property is theft in this work he opposed the institution of decreed property propri t where owners have complete rights to use and abuse their property as they wish proudhon pierre joseph chapter three labour as the efficient cause of the domain of property from what is property one eight four zero he contrasted this with what he called possession or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use later however proudhon added that property is liberty and argued that it was a bulwark against state power his opposition to the state organised religion and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists and made him one of the leading social thinkers

revolutions of one eight four eight during which ten countries had experienced brief or long term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings after most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists anarchists liberals and nationalists to prevent further revolt in spain ram n de la sagra established the anarchist journal el porvenir in la coru a in one eight four five which was inspired by proudhon s ideas the catalan politician francesc pi i margall became the principal translator of proudhon s works into spanish and later briefly became president of spain in one eight seven three while being the leader of the democratic republican federal party according to george woodcock these translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of spanish anarchism after one eight seven zero but before that time proudhonian ideas as interpreted by pi already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early one eight six zero s according to the encyclopedia britannica during the spanish revolution of one eight seven three pi y margall attempted to establish a decentralized or cantonalist political system on proudhonian lines in one eight six four the international workingmen s association sometimes called the first international united diverse revolutionary currents including french followers of proudhon blanquists philadelphes english trade unionists socialists and social democrats due to its links to active workers movements the international became a significant organisation karl marx became a leading figure in the international and a member of its general council proudhon s followers the mutualists opposed marx s state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings woodcock also reports that the american individualist anarchists lysander spooner and william b greene had been members of the first international in one eight six eight following their unsuccessful participation in the league of peace and freedom lpf russian revolutionary mikhail bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the first international which had decided not to get involved with the lpf they allied themselves with the federalist socialist sections of the international who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property at first the collectivists worked with the marxists to push the first international in a more revolutionary socialist direction subsequently the international became polarised into two camps with marx and bakunin as their respective figureheads bakunin characterised marx s ideas as centralist and predicted that if a marxist party came to power its leaders would simply take the place of the ruling class they had fought against anarchist historian george woodcock reports that the annual congress of the international had not taken place in one eight seven zero owing to the outbreak of the paris commune and in one eight seven one the general council called only a special conference in london one delegate was able to attend from spain and none from italy while a technical excuse that they had split away from the f d ration romande was used to avoid inviting bakunin s swiss supporters thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present and the general council s resolutions passed almost unanimously most of them were clearly directed against bakunin and his followers george woodcock anarchism a history of libertarian ideas and movements one nine six two in one eight seven two the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the hague congress where bakunin and james guillaume were expelled from the international and its headquarters were transferred to new york in response the federalist sections formed their own international at the st imier congress adopting a revolutionary anarchist program graham robert anarchism montreal black rose books two zero zero five isbn one five five one six four two five one four the paris commune was a government that briefly ruled paris from one eight march more formally from two eight march to two eight may one eight seven one the commune was the result of an uprising in paris after france was defeated in the franco prussian war anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the paris commune they included louise michel the reclus brothers and eugene varlin the latter murdered in the repression afterwards as for the reforms initiated by the commune such as the re opening of workplaces as co operatives anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised moreover the commune s ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of proudhon on french radical ideas indeed the commune s vision of a communal france based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes bakunin s and proudhon s ideas proudhon like bakunin had argued in favour of the implementation of the binding mandate in one eight four eight and for federation of communes thus both economically and politically the paris commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas george woodcock states organised labour the anti authoritarian sections of the first international were the precursors of the anarcho syndicalists seeking to replace the privilege and authority of the state with the free and

and each other seven police officers and at least four workers were killed eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer the men became international political celebrities among the labour movement four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution the incident became known as the haymarket affair and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight hour day in one eight nine zero a second attempt this time international in scope to organise for the eight hour day was made the event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the haymarket affair although it had initially been conceived as a once off event by the following year the celebration of international workers day on may day had become firmly established as an international worker s holiday in one nine zero seven the international anarchist congress of amsterdam gathered delegates from one four different countries among which important figures of the anarchist movement including errico malatesta pierre monatte luigi fabbri beno t broutchoux emma goldman rudolf rocker and christiaan cornelissen various themes were treated during the congress in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement popular education issues the general strike or antimilitarism a central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and syndicalism or trade union ism malatesta and monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a social revolution while malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient he thought that the trade union movement was reformist and even conservative citing as essentially bourgeois and anti worker the phenomenon of professional union officials malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it the spanish workers federation in one eight eight one was the first major anarcho syndicalist movement anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in spain the most successful was the confederaci n nacional del trabajo national confederation of labour cnt founded in one nine one zero before the one nine four zero s the cnt was the major force in spanish working class politics attracting one five eight million members at one point and playing a major role in the spanish civil war the cnt was affiliated with the international workers association a federation of anarcho syndicalist trade unions founded in one nine two two with delegates representing two million workers from one five countries in europe and latin america in latin america in particular the anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout south and central america and until the early one nine two zero s most of the trade unions in mexico brazil peru chile and argentina were anarcho syndicalist in general outlook the prestige of the spanish c n t as a revolutionary organization was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation the largest and most militant of these organizations was the federaci n obrera regional argentina it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic

assassination attempts from one nine one four to one nine three two in what they saw as attacks on tyrants and enemies of the people some anarchists such as johann most advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter revolutionaries because we preach not only action in and for itself but also action as propaganda by the one eight eight zero s people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan propaganda of the deed to refer to individual bombings regicide s and tyrannicide s from one nine zero five onwards the russian counterparts of these anti syndicalist anarchist communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal expropriations illegalism as a practice emerged and within it the acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins propaganda by the deed and the anarchist burglars individual reappropriation expressed their desperation and their personal violent rejection of an intolerable society moreover they were clearly meant to be exemplary invitations to revolt france s bonnot gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism however as soon as one eight eight seven important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts peter kropotkin thus wrote that year in le r volt that a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite a variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action for example through the trade union movement the anarcho syndicalist fernand pelloutier argued in one eight nine five for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without the individual dynamiter state repression including the infamous one eight nine four french lois sc l rates of the anarchist and labour movement s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics although reciprocally state repression in the first place may have played a role in these isolated acts the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and following the suppression of the one eight seven one paris commune the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies favoured individualist political expression and acts in march one eight seven one the commune took power in the abandoned city and held it for two months then versailles seized the moment to attack and in one horrifying week executed roughly two zero zero

all possibilities of organising on the left not till one eight eight zero was there a general amnesty for exiled and imprisoned communards meanwhile the third republic found itself strong enough to renew and reinforce louis napoleon s imperialist expansion in indochina africa and oceania many of france s leading intellectuals and artists had participated in the commune courbet was its quasi minister of culture rimbaud and pissarro were active propagandists or were sympathetic to it the ferocious repression of one eight seven one and thereafter was probably the key factor in alienating these milieux from the third republic and stirring their sympathy for its victims at home and abroad according to some analysts in post war germany the prohibition of the communist party kdp and thus of institutional far left political organisation may also in the same manner have played a role in the creation of the red army faction numerous heads of state were assassinated between one eight

an attempted coup causing the spanish civil war one nine three six one nine three nine in response to the army rebellion an anarchist inspired movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land but even before the fascist victory in one nine three nine the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the stalinists who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the republican cause from the soviet union according to noam chomsky the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the spanish anarchists not just in catalonia the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere the communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists partially because stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with western countries against hitler that of course failed and stalin withdrew the support to the republic they even withdrew the spanish gold reserves the events known as the spanish revolution was a workers social revolution that began during the outbreak of the spanish civil war in one nine three six and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly libertarian socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years primarily catalonia aragon andalusia and parts of the levante much of spain s economy was put under worker control in anarchist strongholds like catalonia the figure was as high as seven five but lower in areas with heavy communist party of spain influence as the soviet allied party actively resisted attempts at collectivization enactment factories were run through worker committees agrarian areas became collectivised and run as libertarian communes anarchist historian sam dolgoff estimated that about eight

jpguprightortrait of philosopher pierre joseph proudhon one eight zero nine one eight six five by gustave courbet proudhon was the primary proponent of anarchist mutualism and influenced many later individualist anarchist and social anarchist thinkers anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions individualist anarchism and social anarchism which have some different origins values and evolution the individualist wing of anarchism emphasises negative liberty i e opposition to state or social control over the individual while those in the social wing emphasise positive liberty to achieve one s potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill recognizing equality of entitlement in a chronological and theoretical sense there are classical those created throughout the one nine th century and post classical anarchist schools those created since the mid two zero th century and after beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is philosophical anarchism which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a minimal state as unfortunate and usually temporary necessary evil but argue that citizens do not have a moral obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration first adopted by fernando tarrida del m rmol in one eight eight nine in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time in abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms i e collectivist communist mutualist and individualist anarchism it sought to emphasise the anti authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought classical anarchist schools of thought mutualism mutualism began in one eight th century english and french labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with pierre joseph proudhon in france and others in the united states proudhon proposed spontaneous order whereby organisation emerges without central authority a positive anarchy where order arises when everybody does what he wishes and only what he wishes and where business transactions alone produce the social order it is important to recognize that proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance for this reason much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self governance proudhon was heavily involved in french parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers movements and in addition to advocating state protected charters for worker owned cooperatives promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service mutualist anarchism is concerned with reciprocity free association voluntary contract federation and credit and currency reform according to the american mutualist william batchelder greene each worker in the mutualist system would receive just and exact pay for his work services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost without profit or discount mutualism has been retrospectively

the first expression of anarchism godwin a philosophical anarchist from a rationalist and utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a minimal state as a present necessary evil that would

advocating that ownership be collectivised this was to be achieved through violent revolution first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence or propaganda by the deed which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production however collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income as workers would be paid according to time worked rather than receiving goods being distributed according to need as in anarcho communism this position was criticised by anarchist communists as effectively upholding the wages system collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with marxism but opposed the marxist dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society anarchist

fulfillment of individualism the apparent contradiction between individualism and communism rests on a misunderstanding of both subjectivity is also objective the individual really is subjective it is

instruction is exclusive that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary for him without compulsion education was transformed into culture a more recent libertarian

schooling per se the term deschooling was popularised by ivan illich who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead criticisms criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or utopian by its critics european history professor
